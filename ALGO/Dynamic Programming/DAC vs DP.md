Divide and Conquer should be used when the same subproblems are not evaluated many times. Otherwise Dynamic Programming or Memoization should be used. For example, Quicksort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm, we never evaluate the same subproblems again. On the other hand, for calculating the nth Fibonacci number, Dynamic Programming should be preferred.
