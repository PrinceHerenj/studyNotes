Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Whereever we see a recursuve solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.

A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
