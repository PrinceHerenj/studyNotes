#### General Method
In DAC, problem is solved recursively applying three steps at each elevel
* **Divide** the prbolem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
* **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straighforward manner.
* **Combine** the solutions to the subproblems into the solution fo rht original problem.

When subproblems are large enough to solve recursively, we call that the recursive case.
Base case: when the problem cannot be more recursed, thus solved straightforward.
