#### 0/1 Knapsack Problem
There are n items each having a value and weight pair, and a bag/knapsack with a maximum weight limit. Maximize profit of bag without breaking items into smaller fractions.
**Time Complexity**: $O(n\times w)$

#### Fractional Problem
Similar to above knapsack problem, the difference being that the items can be broken down into fractions.
**Time Complexity**: $O(n.log\ n)$
