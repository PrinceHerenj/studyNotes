Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together.
A minimum spanning tree or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

A MST has $V-1$ edges where $V$ is the number of vertices in the given graph.
