A graph is said to be Biconnected in simple terms if:
* It is connected, i.e. all vertices are rechable from source $S$
* Even if a vertex is removed, all vertices are reachable.


**Articulation Point**
A vertex $V(\$)$ in an undirected graph is called an articulation point if removing it disconnects the graph.

Therefore, A Connected Graph is said to be Biconnected if it does not have any Articulation Point.
