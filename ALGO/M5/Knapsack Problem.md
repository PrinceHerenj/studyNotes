In general, knapsack problem involves a bag with limited bag capacity and each item has some weight and value.
The problem is to select items such that weight limit is not exceeded while keeping the maximal values of individual items.

0/1 Knapsack implies that the items cannot be broken down, and are either in or out.
Fractional Knapsack impies that the items can be broken down, to increase total value.
