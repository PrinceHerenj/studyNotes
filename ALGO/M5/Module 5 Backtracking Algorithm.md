Problems that deal with searching for a set of solutions or which may ask for an optimal solution satisfying some constraints can be solved using Backtracking Formulation.

The Brute Force method would be to form n-tuples of solution set and evaluate each one.
Backtracking on the other hand will yield the same answer with far fewer steps than Brute Force.

In order to apply backtracking method the, solution must be presentable in form of a n-tuples $(x_1,x_2,..,x_n)$ where $x_i$ is chosen from a Set $S$. Problem often requries finding a vector for maximizing, minimizing or satisfying a Criterion function $P(x_1,x_2,..,x_n)$.
