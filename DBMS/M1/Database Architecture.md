#### Structure
The database system is partitionaed into modules that deal with each of the responsibilities of the overall system. The functional components of a database system can be broadly divided into the query processor, storage manager and transaction management componenets.

##### Storage Manager
* Storage manager provides the interface between the low-level data stored int he database and the applciation programs and queries submitted in to the system. It is responsible for the interaction with the file manage/disk storage.
* Translates DML statements into low-level file-system commands,
* **Authorization and integrity manager**: tests for the satisfaction of integrity constraints and checks the authority of users to access data.
* **Transaction manager**: ensures database remains in a consistent state despite system failures and concurrent transaction occur
* **File manage**r: manages the allocation of space on disk storage and the data structures used to represent information stored.
* **Buffer manager**: responsible for fetching data from disk storage to main memory, and deciding what data to cache in main memory.

Storage manager implements several data structures as part of physical system implementation.
* **Data files**: which store the database itself
* **Data Dictionary**: which stores metadata about the structure of the database.
* **Indices**: which can provide fast access to data items

##### Query Processor
* **DDL Interpreter**: which interprets DDL statements and records the definitions in the data dictionary
* **DML compiler**: translates DML in query language into an evaluation plan conisisting fof low level instructions that the query evaluation engine understands. DML also performs query optimization
* **Query Evaluation Engine**: which executes low level instructions generated by DML compiler.

#### Architecture
Earlier generation database application used a two-tier architecture, where the application resides at the client mahcine, and invokes database system functionality at the server machine through query language statements

Modern database applications use a three tier architecture, where the client machine acts as merely a fron tend and does not contain any direct database calls. The fron end communicates with application server. The application server communicates with database system to access data. The business logic of the application is embedded into application server.
