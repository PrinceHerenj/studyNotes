Prior to databases there were file processing systems, which had many problems.

* Data Redundancy and Inconsistency: Duplication of data, thereby inconsistent data balues in every instance.
* Difficulty in accessing data: It is difficult since they are separated into different types of files.
* Data Isolation: Problems related to opening different types of files.
* Integrity Problem: Data Values change in incorrect or accidental handling. Data values present must satisfy some consistency constraints
* Atomicity: Transaction in between accounts must be either all or nothing.
* Concurrent access anomalies: Multiple people accessing one instance cannot be created.
* Security Problem: File Systems are open to all, hence unprotected
