A relational database is a database that conforms to the relational model. It contains the following major aspects:
* Structures: Well defined objects store or access the data of a database
* Operation: Clearly defined actions enables application to manipulate the data and structures of a database.
* Integrity rules: Integrity rules govern operation on the data and structures of a database.

A relational database stores data in a set of simple relations. A **relation** is a set of tuples. A **Tuple** is an unordered set of attribute values.

A table is a two dimensionla representation of relation in the form of rows(tuples) and columns(attributes). Each row in a table has the same set of columns.
RDBMS sotres data in relations(tables).

Types of operations: 
* Logical Operations
	* Application specifies what content is required.
	* Access, Adding, Deleting etc.
* Physical Operations
	* Application specifies how things are done.
