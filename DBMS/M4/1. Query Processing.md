#### Query Processing
* range of activites involved in extracting data from database.
* including translation of queries in high level databse languages into expressions that can be used at the physical level of the file system.
* query optimizing transformations
* and actual evaluation

Steps:
1. Parsing and translation
2. Optimization
3. Evaluation

SQL although suitable for human use, is unsuitable for system's internal representation of a query. Extended relational algebra more useful.

Given a query, there are generally a variety of methods for computing the answer

>select salary from instructor where salary < 75000;

This query can be translated into either of the following relational-algebra expressions: 
• σsalary<75000 (Πsalary (instructor))
• Πsalary (σsalary<75000 (instructor))

* A relational-algebra operation annotated with instructions on how to evaluate it is called an evaluation primitive.
* A sequence of primitive operations that can be used to evaluate a query is a query-execution plan or query-evaluation plan
* The query-execution engine takes a query-evaluation plan, executes that plan, and returns the answers to the query

#### Measurement of Query Cost
The cost of query evaluation can be measured in terms of a number of different resources, including disk accesses, CPU time to execute a query, and, in parallel and distributed database systems, the cost of communication
We use the number of blocks transferred from storage and the number of random I/O accesses, each of which will require a disk seek on magnetic storage, as two important factors in estimating the cost of a query-evaluation plan. If the disk subsystem takes an average of tT seconds to transfer a block of data and has an average block-access time (disk seek time plus rotational latency) of tS seconds, then an operation that transfers b blocks and performs S random I/O accesses would take b ∗ tT + S ∗ tS seconds.

The response time for a query-evaluation plan assuming no other activity is going on in the computer, would account for all these costs, and could be used as a measure of the cost of the plan. Unfortunately, the response time of a plan is very hard to estimate without actually executing the plan, for the following two reasons: 
1. The response time depends on the contents of the buffer when the query begins execution; this information is not available when the query is optimized and is hard to account for even if it were available. 
2. In a system with multiple disks, the response time depends on how accesses are distributed among disks, which is hard to estimate without detailed knowledge of data layout on disk

As a result, instead of trying to minimize the response time, optimizers generally try to minimize the total resource consumption of a query plan. Our model of estimating the total disk access time (including seek and data transfer) is an example of such a resource consumption–based model of query cost.

#### Selection Operation
In query processing, the file scan is the lowest-level operator to access data. File scans are search algorithms that locate and retrieve records that fulfill a selection condition. In relational systems, a file scan allows an entire relation to be read in those cases where the relation is stored in a single, dedicated file.

##### Simple Selection

A1 (linear search). In a linear search, the system scans each file block and tests all records to see whether they satisfy the selection condition. An initial seek is required to access the first block of the file. In case blocks of the file are not stored contiguously, extra seeks may be required, but we ignore this effect for simplicity.
Although it may be slower than other algorithms for implementing selection, the linear-search algorithm can be applied to any file, regardless of the ordering of the file, or the availability of indices, or the nature of the selection operation. The other algorithms that we shall study are not applicable in all cases, but when applicable they are generally faster than linear search

Index structures are referred to as access paths, since they provide a path through which data can be located and accessed. Search algorithms that use an index are referred to as index scans.

A2 (clustering index, equality on key). For an equality comparison on a key attribute with a clustering index, we can use the index to retrieve a single record that satisfies the corresponding equality condition.

A3 (clustering index, equality on non-key). We can retrieve multiple records by using a clustering index when the selection condition specifies an equality comparison on a non-key attribute, A. The only difference from the previous case is that multiple records may need to be fetched. However, the records must be stored consecutively in the file since the file is sorted on the search key

A4 (secondary index, equality). Selections specifying an equality condition can use a secondary index. This strategy can retrieve a single record if the equality condition is on a key; multiple records may be retrieved if the indexing field is not a key.

A5 (clustering index, comparison). A clustering ordered index (for example, a clustering B+-tree index) can be used when the selection condition is a comparison. For comparison conditions of the form A > v or A ≥ v, a clustering index on A can be used to direct the retrieval of tuples

A6 (secondary index, comparison). We can use a secondary ordered index to guide retrieval for comparison conditions involving <,≤,≥, or >. The lowest-level index blocks are scanned, either from the smallest value up to v (for < and ≤), or from v up to the maximum value (for > and ≥).


##### Complex Selection
A7 (conjunctive selection using one index).
A8 (conjunctive selection using composite index)
A9 (conjunctive selection by intersection of identifiers)
A10 (disjunctive selection by union of identifiers)

#### Sorting
Sorting of data plays an important role in database systems for two reasons. First, SQL queries can specify that the output be sorted. Second, and equally important for query processing, several of the relational operations, such as joins, can be implemented efficiently if the input relations are first sorted.

We can sort a relation by building an index on the sort key and then using that index to read the relation in sorted order. However, such a process orders the relation only logically, through an index, rather than physically. Hence, the reading of tuples in the sorted order may lead to a disk access (disk seek plus block transfer) for each record, which can be very expensive, since the number of records can be much larger than the number of blocks.


##### External Sort-Merge
Running explained here: [Query Processing : External sort merge algorithm - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfF6ftMUNwo)
Cost Analysis
* br denotes the number of blocks
* each br has a read and write therefore cost = 2 * br
* initial number of runs = br/M (M = number of blocks in main memory). number of runs decreases by a factor of M -1. therefore total merge passes required: $log_{M-1}(b_r/M)$ 
* Ignoring savings, **Total Block Transfers =** $b_r * (2log_{M-1}(b_r/M)+1)$

Disk Seek Cost
* Each run requires seek reads and write. = 2 * $b_r/M$
* During merge if data are read $b_b$ blocks at a atime from each run file. seeks for reading and writing are 2 * $b_r/b_b$
* **Total Seeks** = 2$b_r/M$ + $b_r/b_b$ 2$log_{M-1}(b_r/M)-1$

#### Join Operation
##### Nested Loop Join

for each tuple tr in r do begin 
	for each tuple ts in s do begin 
		test pair (tr, ts) to see if they satisfy the join condition θ 
		if they do, add tr ⋅ ts to the result; 
	end 
end

##### Block Nested Loop Join

for each block Br of r do begin 
	for each block Bs of s do begin 
		for each tuple tr in Br do begin 
			for each tuple ts in Bs do begin 
				test pair (tr, ts) to see if they satisfy the join condition 
				if they do, add tr ⋅ ts to the result; 
			end 
		end 
	end 
end

##### Merge Join


#### Other Operations
* Duplicate Elimination
* Projection
* Set Operations: 
	We can implement the union, intersection, and set-difference operations by first sorting both relations, and then scanning once through each of the sorted relations to produce the result. In r ∪ s, when a concurrent scan of both relations reveals the same tuple in both files, only one of the tuples is retained. The result of r ∩ s will contain only those tuples that appear in both relations. We implement set difference, r − s, similarly, by retaining tuples in r only if they are absent in s
	• r ∪ s 1. Build an in-memory hash index on ri . 2. Add the tuples in si to the hash index only if they are not already present. 3. Add the tuples in the hash index to the result
	• r ∩ s 1. Build an in-memory hash index on ri . 2. For each tuple in si , probe the hash index and output the tuple to the result only if it is already present in the hash index
	• r − s 1. Build an in-memory hash index on ri . 2. For each tuple in si , probe the hash index, and, if the tuple is present in the hash index, delete it from the hash index. 3. Add the tuples remaining in the hash index to the result.
* Outer Join
* Aggregation
#### Evaluation of Expressions
The obvious way to evaluate an expresion is simply to evaluate one operation at a time, in an appropriate order. The result of each evaluation is materialized in a temporary relation for subsequent use.
An alternative approach is to evaluate several operations simulataneously in a pipeline, with the results of one operations passed on to the next.

##### Materialization
It is easiest to understand intuitively how to evaluate an expression by looking at a pictorial representation of the expression in an operator tree. Consider the expression: Πname(σbuilding =“Watson”(department) ⋈ instructor)
![[Pasted image 20220723110846.png]]
* Start on low level operations
* At each level create a materialized table which is temporary and can be used for upper level operations

Evaluation as just described is called materialized evaluation, since the results of each intermediate operation are created (materialized) and then are used for evaluation of the next-level operations.

##### Pipelining
We can improve query-evaluation efficiency by reducing the number of temporary files that are produced. We achieve this reduction by combining several relational operations into a pipeline of operations, in which the results of one operation are passed along to the next operation in the pipeline. Evaluation as just described is called pipelined evaluation. For example, consider the expression (Πa1,a2(r ⋈ s)). If materialization were applied, evaluation would involve creating a temporary relation to hold the result of the join and then reading back in the result to perform the projection. These operations can be combined: When the join operation generates a tuple of its result, it passes that tuple immediately to the project operation for processing. By combining the join and the projection, we avoid creating the intermediate result and instead create the final result directl
