Query optimzation is the process of selecting the most efficient query evaluation plan from among the many strategies usually possible for processing a given query, especially if the query is complex.

An evaluation plan defines exactly what algorithm should be used for each operation and how the execution of the operations should be coordinated.![[Pasted image 20220723112456.png]]

To find the least costly query-evaluation plan, the optimizer needs to generate alternative plans that produce the same result as the given expression and to choose the least costly one. Generation of query-evaluation plans involves three steps: (1) generating expressions that are logically equivalent to the given expression, (2) annotating the resultant expressions in alternative ways to generate alternative query-evaluation plans, and (3) estimating the cost of each evaluation plan, and choosing the one whose estimated cost is the least

#### Transformation of Relational Expressions
A query can be expressed in several different ways, with different costs of evaluation. In this section, rather than take the relational expression as given, we consider alternative, equivalent expressions. Two relational-algebra expressions are said to be equivalent if, on every legal database instance, the two expressions generate the same set of tuples.

##### Equivalence Rules
An equivalence rule says that expressions of two forms are equivalent. We can replace an expression of the first form with an expression of the second form, or vice versa
1. Conjunctive selection operations can be deconstructed into a sequence of individual selections. This transformation is referred to as a cascade of σ. σθ1∧θ2 (E) ≡ σθ1 (σθ2 (E))
2. Selection operations are commutative. σθ1 (σθ2 (E)) ≡ σθ2 (σθ1 (E))
3. Only the final operations in a sequence of projection operations are needed; the others can be omitted. This transformation can also be referred to as a cascade of Π. ΠL1 (ΠL2 (…(ΠLn (E))…)) ≡ ΠL1 (E)
4. Selections can be combined with Cartesian products and theta joins. a. σθ(E1 × E2) ≡ E1 ⋈θ E2 This expression is just the definition of the theta join. b. σθ1 (E1 ⋈θ2 E2) ≡ E1 ⋈θ1∧θ2 E2
5. Theta-join operations are commutative. E1 ⋈θ E2 ≡ E2 ⋈θ E1
6. a. Natural-join operations are associative. (E1 ⋈ E2) ⋈ E3 ≡ E1 ⋈ (E2 ⋈ E3) b. Theta joins are associative in the following manner: (E1 ⋈θ1 E2) ⋈θ2∧θ3 E3 ≡ E1 ⋈θ1∧θ3 (E2 ⋈θ2 E3)
7. The set operations union and intersection are commutative.
8. Set union and intersection are associative. a. (E1 ∪ E2) ∪ E3 ≡ E1 ∪ (E2 ∪ E3) b. (E1 ∩ E2) ∩ E3 ≡ E1 ∩ (E2 ∩ E3)
9. Set union and intersection are associative. a. (E1 ∪ E2) ∪ E3 ≡ E1 ∪ (E2 ∪ E3) b. (E1 ∩ E2) ∩ E3 ≡ E1 ∩ (E2 ∩ E3)
10. The projection operation distributes over the union operation ΠL(E1 ∪ E2) ≡ (ΠL(E1)) ∪ (ΠL(E2))

##### Join Ordering
A good ordering of join operations is important for reducing the size of temporary results; hence, most query optimizers pay a lot of attention to the join order

#### Estimating Statistics of Expression Results
Given a query expression, we consider it as a tree; we can start from the bottomlevel operations, and estimate their statistics, and continue the process on higher-level operations, till we reach the root of the tree. The size estimates that we compute as part of these statistics can be used to compute the cost of algorithms for individual operations in the tree, and these costs can be added up to find the cost of an entire query plan

##### Catalog Information
The database-system catalog stores the following statistical information about database relations: 
• nr, the number of tuples in the relation r. 
• br, the number of blocks containing tuples of relation r. 
• l r, the size of a tuple of relation r in bytes. 
• fr, the blocking factor of relation r—that is, the number of tuples of relation r that fit into one block. 
• V (A,r), the number of distinct values that appear in the relation r for attribute A. This value is the same as the size of ΠA(r). If A is a key for relation r, V (A,r) is nr.

##### Selection Size Estimation
The size estimate of the result of a selection operation depends on the selection predicate. We first consider a single equality predicate, then a single comparison predicate, and finally combinations of predicates.
* σA=a(r): If a is a frequently occurring value for which the occurrence count is available, we can use that value directly as the size estimate for the selection.
* σA≤v(r): Consider a selection of the form σA≤v(r). Suppose that the lowest and highest values (min(A,r) and max(A,r)) for the attribute are stored in the catalog. Assuming that values are uniformly distributed, we can estimate the number of records that will satisfy the condition A ≤ v as: 
	* 0 if v < min(A,r) 
	* nr if v ≥ max(A,r), and, 
	* nr ⋅ v−min(A,r) /  max(A,r)−min(A,r) , otherwise.

##### Join Size Estimation
The Cartesian product r × s contains nr ∗ ns tuples. Each tuple of r × s occupies l r + l s bytes
* If R ∩ S = ∅—that is, the relations have no attribute in common—then r ⋈ s is the same as r × s
* If R ∩ S is a key for R, then we know that a tuple of s will join with at most one tuple from r. Therefore, the number of tuples in r ⋈ s is no greater than the number of tuples in s.
* The most difficult case is when R ∩ S is a key for neither R nor S. In this case, we assume, as we did for selections, that each value appears with equal probability
##### Size Estimation for Other Operations
* Projection: The estimated size (number of records or number of tuples) of a projection of the form ΠA(r) is V (A,r), since projection eliminates duplicates.
* Aggregation: The size of GγA(r) is simply V (G,r), since there is one tuple in GγA(r) for each distinct value of G.
* Set operations: If the two inputs to a set operation are selections on the same relation, we can rewrite the set operation as disjunctions, conjunctions, or negations.
* Outer join: The estimated size of r ⟕s is the size of r ⋈ s plus the size of r; that of r ⟖s is symmetric, while that of r⟗s is the size of r ⋈ s plus the sizes of r and s. All three estimates may be inaccurate, but provide upper bounds on the sizes.

#### Choice of Evaluation Plans
Given an evaluation plan, we can estimate its cost using statistics estimated by the techniques. A cost-based optimizer explores the space of all query-evaluation plans that are equivalent to the given query, and chooses the one with the least estimated cost.
