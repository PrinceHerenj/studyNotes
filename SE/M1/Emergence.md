#### Early Computer Programming (1950s)
* [[Ad Hoc Style]] usage was universal
---

#### High Level Programming (early 1960s)
* reduced software development efforts greatly.
* still Ad Hoc.
---

#### Control Flow Design (late 1960s)
* Size and Complexity Increased. Ad Hoc started dying, hard to write cost effective programs correctly.
* Programs writted by others difficult to understand.
* "Pay particular attention to design of program's control flow structure."
	* Sequence in which instructions in program are executed.
	* Flow charting was developed. Program having messy flow chart was difficult to understand and debug
* GOTO made culprit and decided to remove.
	* Dijkstra 'Goto Statement Considered Harmful' 1969
	* Acceptance of removal by everyone

#### Structured Programming
**Single entry, Single exit constructs**

**Important Constructs:**
* Sequence: Statements
* Selection: Decision Making
* Iteration: Loops

**Allowed**: break and continue statements

---

#### Data Structure Oriented Design (early 1970s)
Techniques Emphasizing use of Data Structures along with Structured Programming.
* Jackson' Structured Programming(1970)
---

#### Data Flow Oriented Design (late 1970s)
* Identification of data items in program
* Processing required to get proper output from input.
* First Function development to integrate processing of data items
---

#### Object Oriented Design (1980s)
* Natural objects belonging to a Class are identified
* Relationships between Objects
* Abstraction came onto place.
* 'Dont Repeat Yourself' DRY code
