#### Chunking
Storing interelated items in one place in memory


**Human Memory** subdivided into:
#### Short Term
* Items stored can be lost with decay or displacement with new information

#### Long Term
* Items stored for a long period of time.

#### Implication in Program Development
* As number of variables increases difficult to keep in Short Term memory.
* Robotic Development is Linear, SE aims to bring human development close to being linear.
**Abstraction:** Hide unnecessary details
**Decomposition**: Subdivision of a large program into smaller problem.
