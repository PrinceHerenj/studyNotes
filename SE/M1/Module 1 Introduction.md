#### Definition
A systematic collection of good program development practices and techniques is known as Software Engineering.
An engineering approach to software development.

Just as any other engineering discipline, SE makes heavy use of knowledge that has been collected from experiences of a large number of practioners.

As in all engineering disciplines, there exist conflictions while solving a problem. Several solutions are proposed, from which the most effective and efficient one is chosen on **cost,  maintainability and usability.**

Software engineering makes use of only well-understood and well-documented software development principles to reduce cost.
