#### Definition
Software Project Management enables a team of developers to work efficiently towards successful completion of a software project.

#### Project Manager Responsiblities
* Project Proposal Writing
* Project Cost Estimation
* Scheduling
* Project Staffing
* Project Monitoring and control
* Risk Management
* Managerial Report Writing and presentations

#### Project Planning
Once found feasible, a project manager undertake project planning.
##### Activities Include:
* Estimation
	* Effort, Cost, Resource, Duration
* Project Scheduling: After project parameters have been estimated, the schedule for manpower and other resources
* Staff Organization: Staffing plans are made.
* Risk Handling: Risk Identification, Analysis
* Misc plans: Quality Assurance

##### Sliding Window Planning
* Planning over several stages
* prevent big commitments too early
* Facilitates accurate planning; more info availabe as project progresses

#### Project Size Estimation Metrics
The project size is a measure of the problem complexity in terms of effort and time required.

##### Lines of Code
* This metric measure the size of a project by counting the number of source instructions in the developed program.
* It is a measure of coding activity alone.
* LOC count depends on the choice of specific instructions from random developer.
* It correlates poorly with the quality and efficieny of code.
* Can only be estimated after development completed.

##### Function Point
* The function point metrix is based on the idea that a softwre product supporting many features would certainly be of larger size than a product with less number of features.

#### Project Cost Estimation Techniques
From Size Estimation Metrics, determine effort and time estimation, and provide total cost of Project

#### COCOMO
