Systematic Development uses:

* Use of
	* [[Life Cycle Models]]
	* Requirement Analysis and Specification
		* Lot of attention to requirement
	* Design
		* Standard Design techniques introduced
	* Coding
		* In Ad Hoc Style, coding synonymous with program development
		* now only a small part of program development
	* Testing
		* Systematic; Standard techniques available.
* Emphasis shift from error correction to prevention
	* Detection of errors as soon as introduction.
	* In [[Ad Hoc Style]] errors detected during testing
	* Now errors detected in each phase of development
* Periodic Reviews in each phase
* Better Visibility of Design and Code
	* Good Quality, Consistent and Standard Documents
	* Results in fault diagnosis and smoother maintenance.
* Planning
	* Estimation
	* Scheduling
	* Monitoring Mechanisms
* Use of Computer Aided Software Engineering Tools
