##### Definition
Expierienced developers take considerable time to understand the exact requirements of the customer and to meticulously document those. They know that without a clear understanding of the problem and proper documentation of the same, it is impossible to develop a satisfactory solution.

##### Goal
The goal of the requirements analysis and specification phase is to **clearly understand the customer requirements**, **remove requirement problems** and **to systematically organise the requirements into the [[SRS]]**. 
The phase starts after the feasibility stage is complete and project is found to be financial viable and technically feasible and ends when SRS document is completed.
Requirement analysis and specification is carried out by a few expierienced members of the dev team in customer site. The engineers that gather, analyse and then write these data are called **analysts**.
After completion of SRS, first it is validated by internal dev team, then by the customer.

##### Requirement Gathering
aka requirement elicitation. Gathering requirements is done by stakeholders.
Process:
* Study existing documentation: Customers usually provide Statement of Purpose.
* Interview: Different categories of users request different features in vague terms.
* Task Analysis: Devs regard product as a set of services that it offers. Service is also known as a task. Representation of each task as subtasks.
* Scenario Analysis: 
* Form analysis:

##### Requirement Analysis
Its main purpose is to analyse the gathered requirements to remove all ambiguities, incompleteness, and inconsistencies.

Requirement Problems in detail
1. Anomaly: is ambiguity or inexactness in a requirement. Ambiguos activities lack quantification and are subjectivelt interpreted. Good Bad Maybe are ambigous identities.
2. Inconsistency: Two requirements are said to be inconsistent, if one of the requirements contradicts the other.
3. Incompleteness: Incomplete set of requirements is one in whihc some requirement has been overlooked.
