##### Users
* Users, customers, marketing personnel
* Software developers
* Test Engineers
* User documentation writers
* Project managers
* Maintenance engineers

##### Characterisitics of a Good SRS Document
* Concise
* Implementation Independent
* Traceable
* Modifiable
* Identification of Response to undesired events
* Verifiable

#### Important Categories of Customer Requirements
An SRS document should clearly document the following aspects of a software:
* ==**Functional requirements**==
  Set of high level functions.A high-level function is one using which the user can get some useful piece of work done, converting some input to output through processing.
* ==**Non-functional requirements**==
	* Design and Implementation constraints: Describe any items that will limit the options available to the devs. Corporate/Regulatory policies
	* External interfaces required: Hardware, Software and Communications interface, user interfaces, report formats
	* Other non-functional requirements such as maintainability, portability, usability.
* ==**Goals of implementation**==: A goal in contrast to the functional and non-functional requirements is not checked by the customer for conformance at the time of acceptance testing.

#### Processing Logic in Functional Requirements
==**Decision Trees**==
* Edges represent conditions, Leaf Nodes are actions
* Gives graphic view of logic involved and respective action taken.

==**Decision Tables**==
Specify
* variables to be tested
* actions to be taken
* order of decision making

#### Formal Specification
It is a heuristical technique to accurately specify a system, verify implementation satisfies specification, and prove properties of specification. Mathematical techniques include: Logic, Sets, Algebra, State Machines.
HARD to use.
##### Semi-Formal Specification
SADT
PSL
##### Executable Specification Language 
If specification in formal language, possible to execute specification to provide system prototype.
4GLs are example of Executable Specification Language
