### Design Patterns
Design Patterns are commonly accepted solutions to some problems that often recurs as subproblems while designing different applications.

#### Types of patterns
* Architectural Patterns:
	* Provide sultions to problems that are identifiable while carry out high-level designs. These cannot be directly translated to code, but form the basis for more detailed design.
* Design Patterns: 
	* Suggests a scheme for structuring the classes in a design solutions and also defines the interaction among those classes.
* Idioms
	* Low Level Patterns that are programming language specific.

Patterns vs Algorithm: In contrast to algorithms, patterns are more concerned with aspects such as maintainability and ease of developemnt rather than space and time efficiency.
