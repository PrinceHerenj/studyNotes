#### Capability Maturity Model
Developed by SEI uni USA,
CMM is a model for apprising the software process maturity of a contractor into different levels.

##### Capability Evaluation
Provides a way to assess software process capability of an org
* Helps in selecting a contractor
* Indicates contractor performance

##### Software Process Assessment
Suggest ways to improve process capability
Internal use only.

SEI classifies software dev industries into five maturity levels;
**Initial**
* Org operate without any formalized process/plans
* Ad Hoc and chaotic
* Engineers follow their own process

**Repeatable**
* Basic project management practices
* Size and Cost Estimation, FP COCOMO

**Defined**
* Management and dev activities are defined and documented.
* ISO 9001 aims here

**Managed**
* Organization sets quatitive quality goals
* Results of measurement used to evaluate project performance rather than improving process.

**Optimizing**
* Continuous Process improvement based on measurements

##### Key Process areas
Each level is associated with key process area
* Level 2 KPA: Software Project Planning
* Level 3 KPA: Process Definition, Review, Training program
* Level 4 KPA: Quantitative measurements, Process Management
* Level 5 KPA: Defect Prevention, Process Change management, Tech Change management

#### Capability Maturity Model Integration
* successor of CMM
* Goal is to integrate many differen models into one framework.
* CMM incompatible with small orgs.
