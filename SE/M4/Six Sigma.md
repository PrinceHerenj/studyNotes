Quantitative approach to eliminate defects
Statistical representation of Six Sigma describes how a process is performing

To achieve six sigma,
* a process must not produce more than 3.4 defects per million oppurtunities
* 5 Sigma: 230 defects per million
* 4 Sigma: 6210 defects per million

Methodologies:
* Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control DMAIC
* Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify DMADV
