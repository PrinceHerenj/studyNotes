Good Documentation enhances understandability and maintainability of a software product

#### Internal Documentation
Documentation provided in the source code itself
provided through
* Meaningful variable names
* Code Indentation
* Structuring
* Enumerated Types, constant identifiers and User Defined data types
* Module headers and comments

#### External Documentation
Documentation other than present in source code.
* User's manual
* SRS
* Design Document
* Test Document
* Installation instructions

Consistency should be present, external documents production in an orderly fashion.
Even a few out of date documents can create severe confusion.

##### Textual Documents
* Readability determines understandability hence determines maintainability
