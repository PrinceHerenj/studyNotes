* Efficiency
* Portability
	* Easily made to work in different OSs, machines
* Usability
	* Different skill users can effectively use the product
* Reusability
	* Modules easily reusable
* Maintainability
	* Error easily correctable when they show up
	* New functions added easily

* **Statistical QC**: Quality inferred using Statistics

**Quality Assurance** followed:
> If org's processes are good and followed rigorously, products are bound to be of good quality.
* Guidance for recognizing defining analyzing and improving production process

##### **Total Quality Management**: 
Continuous process improvements through process measurements
**Business Process Reengineering**: Aims at continuous process improvement
TQM effective on software process, BPR effective on business carried out in org
* Quality paradigm has shifted from **product assurance** to **process assurance**.
* Process improvement
	* improve product quality
	* reduce costs
	* accelerate schedules
	* Cycle:
