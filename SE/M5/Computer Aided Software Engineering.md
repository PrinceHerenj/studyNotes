CASE tools is a generic term denotes any form of automated support for software engineering.
CASE tool automates some software development activity.

CASE tools assist in phase related tasks, like specification, structure analysis and design, coding, testing

##### Objective of CASE
* To increase productivity
* To help produce better quality software at lower cost.

True power of the toolset can be realized only when all CASE tools are integrated together.
All tools share a central data dictionary repository which contains all Primitive and Non Primitive data.
CASE helps automate step-by-step methodologies

##### Tools
* Consistency Check
* Project Management
* Coding support
* Document Generation
* Config/Version Management
* Testing
* Structured design and analysis

##### Benefit of CASE
* Cost saving between 30% to 40%
* Improved quality: Easy to move from one phase to another, chances of human error reduced. Higher quality and consistent documents
* Redundancy reduced
* No checking for DFDs, easily draw diagrams
* Introduction of CASE makes engineers oriented and orderly.

##### Prototyping Support
* Creating GUI using editor

#### Features of CASE
**SASD**: support SASD design technique. diagrams, easy navigation b/w different levels of design.
**Code Generator**: Low support; only module skeletons generated, and also header information. Should generate data records and store them in databases. prototype for X window and MS window
**Testing**: Static and Dynamic analysis; test report in ASCII format
**Simultaenous Workflow**: Multiple users can code at same time; also separate windows
**Documentation**: Automatic up to date documentation generation
**Project Management**: Estimate task duration, manage file creation, completiong dates, dates of reviews etc.
**External Interface**: Reusability of design
**RE support**: Structure chart, DFD and data dictionary from source code.
**Data Dictionary Interface**: view, update, print data defintions; query language support, analysis
**Tutorial and Help**: for new users

#### Next Gen CASE
* Support any methodology
* Automatic diagrams
* Many tools in one env
* Customization: Define new types of objects and connections
